# scraper.py
### This readme is intended to familiarize you with how to download, run, and read files generated by scraper.py

To run scraper.py, [first, ensure you have Git downloaded for your operating system](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once that is set up successfullly, visit [the conda.io website here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) and download the installer for your computer's operating system.
1. [Windows installation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html#installing-on-windows)
2. [macOS installation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html#installing-on-macos)
3. [Linux installation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html#installing-on-linux)

Then, using Git from your operating system's terminal, clone the repo located at https://github.com/sphills/CS325_Project_1.git by using the command
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/sphills/CS325_Project_1.git
```
[Using the instructions provided here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#cloning-an-environment), start your base conda environment, navigate to the same directory/folder you cloned the git repo to, and use 
```commandline
clone create --name myclone --clone scraper
```
to download the required libraries and create an environment suitable to run scraper.py.

Once that's completed, use the command
```commandline
conda activate myclone
```
to start using the same conda environment as the one scraper.py was developed in. Then, once that environment has been activated, use
```commandline
python scraper.py
```
in your conda terminal to run the program. This should create five files, which you can read ad-free!

### Congratulations, you've successfully run scraper.py!
