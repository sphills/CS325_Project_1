Are cars getting too big for the road?

In some parts of the world, cars have always been on the larger side. But now these behemoths are spreading – and the consequences are still being figured out.
The 2024 Chevrolet Suburban, a nine-passenger sports utility vehicle (SUV), measures 225.7 inches (18ft/5.5m), and is advertised as "a room with a view". A seven-seat, fully electric crossover vehicle designed by Kia houses an 800-Volt battery that weighs, on average, 1,000lb (450kg). An electric Hummer SUV, meanwhile, has a maximum width, including mirrors, of 93.7in (2.4m).
Large cars are becoming ever more popular. In fact, the size of the average car is growing wider at a rate of 1cm (0.4in) every two years, according to the non-profit Transport and Environment. With this increase in size comes some equally large problems, from environmental repercussions to safety hazards, and the sheer difficulty of manoeuvring cars in streets and parking spaces designed for smaller models.
As the city of Paris, France, votes to triple the parking fees for visitors' SUVs in its streets, what can be done to remedy the challenges that come with large cars?
How the car got so big
Car shapes and sizes have steadily ballooned since the late 1970s. The reasons for this increase are various and complex. The addition of safety features like lateral and frontal airbags and "crumple zones" required more space, while consumers began to seek out luxury, exotic and import vehicles. Finally, the auto industry incentivised the purchase of trucks and SUVs over lighter sedans.
In 1975, the US Congress amended fuel economy regulations on new passenger vehicles in the form of Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards. These standards determine fuel-economy targets, but instated more lenient requirements for light trucks and SUVs than standard cars. The standards have been updated since, but still allow lower fuel-efficiency standards for larger vehicles.
There are other factors at play too. It used to be the case that a single manufacturer would offer smaller vehicle variants in Europe, South America and parts of Asia, while consumers in the US (and China, the world's largest car market) could select from a range of much larger options.
